# Contributor's Guide

I'd Welcome anyone that would like to contribute to this project.  This project
was largely created for my personal use.  However if you use it and find it
useful and want to contribute to its development you may do any of the
following.

## Open an Issue

If you have a problem with the current implementation or there is a feature or
something you would like to see added.  Please open a issue on this github
repository.

Make the title short and to the point, if its a bug, feature request, etc.

Write a descriptive message, describing as close to possible what is that you
would like to see or what is not working for you.

## Creating Pull request

Pull request would be welcome. However I do ask a few things be done before
making one.

1. Please make all your changes to a branch
2. Name the branch along the lines of feature/something or fix/something
2. Make your commit messages using a short descriptive title, preferably in
   "Title Case".
3. Add a longer description after the title that describes the changes being
   implemented.
5. Make your pull request against the staging branch

If then everything is working it will be merged into the master branch.

## Linting Setup

You should have [ESLint running in your editor][1], and it will highlight
anything that doesn't conform with the linting rules that I have setup for this
repository.
